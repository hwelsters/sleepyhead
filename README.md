<p align="center">
  A data collection, analysis, dataset generation, and ChatGPT research toolkit for people who take lots of naps 💤.
</p>


## Steps
- Generated a dataset of math question sets using preexisting datasets as templates.
- Try out a bunch of models as well as various combinations of the models
- Asks ChatGPT math equations
- Calculate causality values
- Sleep for 8 hrs (important for brain function)
- Wake up
- Profit 💰

## Get involved
- 🐛 **Found a bug?** - Create an [issue][issue]  
- ⚙️ **Interested in adding a feature?** - Check out the [project roadmap](ROADMAP.md) or suggest your own changes by creating an [issue][issue]   
- 📖 **Can we improve the documentation?** - Even pull requests for small changes can be helpful. Feel free to change the [documentation][docs]!  
- 😵 **See something wrong with the dataset?** - While our dataset may be accurate most of the time, we make the assumption that the preexisting datasets have the correct working and that the questions use only distinct numbers.
