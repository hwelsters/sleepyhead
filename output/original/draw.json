So, his speed downstream is:\n\n15 + c\n\nWhen Junior goes upstream, his effective speed is the difference between the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the current. So, his speed upstream is:\n\n15 - c\n\nWe know that it takes the same amount of time for Junior to travel 12 miles downstream as it does for him to travel 9 miles upstream. We can express this as an equation:\n\ntime taken to go downstream = time taken to go upstream\n\nWe can use the formula time = distance / speed to write this as:\n\n12 / (15 + c) = 9 / (15 - c)\n\nNow, we can solve for 'c' by cross-multiplying and simplifying the equation:\n\n12(15 - c) = 9(15 + c)\n180 - 12c = 135 + 9c\n21c = 45\nc = 2.14 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the speed of the current is approximately 2.14 miles per hour."}
