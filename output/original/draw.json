So, his speed downstream is:\n\n15 + c\n\nWhen Junior goes upstream, his effective speed is the difference between the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the current. So, his speed upstream is:\n\n15 - c\n\nWe know that it takes the same amount of time for Junior to travel 12 miles downstream as it does for him to travel 9 miles upstream. We can express this as an equation:\n\ntime taken to go downstream = time taken to go upstream\n\nWe can use the formula time = distance / speed to write this as:\n\n12 / (15 + c) = 9 / (15 - c)\n\nNow, we can solve for 'c' by cross-multiplying and simplifying the equation:\n\n12(15 - c) = 9(15 + c)\n180 - 12c = 135 + 9c\n21c = 45\nc = 2.14 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the speed of the current is approximately 2.14 miles per hour."}

{"question_number": 64, "response": "Let's call the number of adults 'x' and the number of children 'y'. \n\nWe know that there were a total of 429 people at the play: \n\nx + y = 429 \n\nWe also know that the total receipts were $372.50: \n\n1x + 0.75y = 372.5 \n\nWe can simplify the second equation by multiplying both sides by 4: \n\n4x + 3y = 1490 \n\nNow we can solve the system of equations by elimination. Multiplying the first equation by 3: \n\n3x + 3y = 1287 \n\nSubtracting this from the second equation: \n\n(4x + 3y) - (3x + 3y) = 1490 - 1287 \n\nx = 203 \n\nSo there were 203 adults at the play. We can use the first equation to find the number of children: \n\nx + y = 429 \n\n203 + y = 429 \n\ny = 226 \n\nSo there were 226 children at the play. \n\nTherefore, there were 203 adults and 226 children at the play."}
{"question_number": 65, "response": "Let's call the amount of salt that needs to be added 'x' in grams.\n\nWe know that the initial solution is 60 grams of a 20% salt solution. This means that the solution contains 0.20 \u00d7 60 = 12 grams of salt.\n\nWe want to increase the salt content to 25%. This means that we want to end up with a total of 25% of the final solution as salt. \n\nWe can set up an equation to represent this:\n\n(12 + x)/(60 + x) = 0.25\n\nSimplifying this equation: \n\n12 + x = 0.25(60 + x)\n\n12 + x = 15 + 0.25x\n\n0.75x = 3\n\nx = 4\n\nSo we need to add 4 grams of salt to the 60 grams of the 20% salt solution to increase the salt content to 25%."}
{"question_number": 66, "response": "\n\nLet's start by assigning variables to the ages of the man and his wife, both ten years ago and now. \n\nLet the man's age now be M, and his wife's age now be W. \n\nTen years ago, the man was M-10, and his wife was W-10. \n\nWe know that ten years ago, the man's age was equal to his wife's current age, so we can set up an equation: \n\nM-10 = W \n\nWe also know that the man is now twice as old as his wife was ten years ago, so we can set up another equation: \n\nM = 2(W-10) \n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns, so we can solve for M and W. \n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get: \n\nM = 2(W-10) \n\nM = 2W - 20 \n\nM - 2W = -20 \n\nSubstituting M-10 for W in the equation above, we get: \n\nM - 2(M-10) = -20 \n\nM - 2M + 20 = -20 \n\n-M = -60 \n\nM = 60 \n\nSo the man is 60 years old now. \n\nSubstituting M-10 for W in the first equation, we get: \n\nM-10 = W \n\n60-10 = W \n\nW = 50 \n\nSo the woman is 50 years old now. \n\nTherefore, the man is 60 years old and his wife is 50 years old."}
{"question_number": 67, "response": "Let's call the two numbers x and y. \n\nWe know that their sum is 70, so we can set up the equation: \n\nx + y = 70 \n\nWe also know that one of the numbers (let's say x) is ten more than twice the other number (y): \n\nx = 2y + 10 \n\nNow we can substitute the second equation into the first equation: \n\n(2y + 10) + y = 70 \n\nSimplifying the left side: \n\n3y + 10 = 70 \n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides: \n\n3y = 60 \n\nDividing both sides by 3: \n\ny = 20 \n\nNow we know that y is 20. We can substitute that back into the equation x = 2y + 10: \n\nx = 2(20) + 10 \n\nx = 50 \n\nSo the two numbers are 20 and 50."}
